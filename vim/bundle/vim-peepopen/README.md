vim-peepopen
=============

A plugin for the Vim text editor. PeepOpen provides fuzzy search of filenames and paths in a programming project.

Installation
------------

Get the FuzzyWindow.app and open it at least once to approve the Mac OS X security dialog.

Standard:

Copy all files to your ~/.vim directory, specifically the contents of the `plugin` directory.

Pathogen:

Copy the entire `vim-peepopen` plugin to your `~/.vim/bundle` directory.

Get Tim Pope's excellent pathogen plugin at http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.

Usage
-----

`<Leader>p` opens the current project directory with the PeepOpen application.

Use vim-rooter for automatic assignment of the current working directory for projects stored in Git.

(Leader is mapped to '\' by default)
